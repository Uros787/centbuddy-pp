**Privacy Policy for CentBuddy**

Effective Date: 12.02.2025

At CentBuddy, we respect your privacy and are committed to safeguarding the personal information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the CentBuddy app (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information when you use CentBuddy:

Personal Information: If you subscribe to our in-app subscriptions (monthly or yearly), your payment information is handled through Apple's or Google's payment systems. We do not collect or store your credit card details. The only personal information we may have is your account details, such as your name and email, which are processed via these third-party payment systems.

Usage Data: We do not collect non-personally identifiable data regarding how you interact with the App. This includes your device type, operating system, app features used, and other usage statistics that help us improve the App.

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information for the following purposes:

To Provide In-App Subscriptions: Your payment details are processed by Apple or Google to manage your subscription.
To Improve the App: We analyze usage data to enhance the user experience and app functionality.
To Communicate with You: We may send updates and notifications about new features, subscription renewals, and important information regarding your use of the App.

3. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
CentBuddy offers in-app subscription options, including monthly and yearly plans. All payments for subscriptions are processed through Apple's or Google's payment systems, which means we do not store your financial information.

Subscription Renewal: Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless canceled. You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device’s settings (via Apple or Google).
Subscription Cancellation: You may cancel your subscription at any time. After cancellation, you will retain access to the premium features until the end of your current billing period.

4. Data Storage and Security
All information entered or generated within the app is stored locally on your device. We do not collect or store any data remotely, and we do not have access to your personal data or usage information unless it is shared with us directly through in-app subscriptions. Your data is entirely under your control.

Data Deletion: If you uninstall the app, any locally stored data will be deleted permanently unless backed up by your device's backup functionality.
Security: We use standard industry practices to ensure your data is secure on your device. However, please note that no method of data storage or transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

5. Third-Party Services
RevenueCat is a third-party service used to manage subscriptions and handle purchase-related data. When you make a purchase, RevenueCat collects information related to your subscription for the purpose of managing billing, renewals, and subscription status. This data may include your name, email address, and subscription history.
We do not collect or store sensitive payment details directly. Payment processing is handled through Apple or Google, and all sensitive payment information is managed securely by these services.

6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
CentBuddy does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or any other method to collect personal data. All information remains stored locally on your device, and no data is transmitted to external servers.

7. Children’s Privacy
CentBuddy is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13 years old. Since no personal data is collected, no special measures are necessary for protecting children’s privacy.

8. Your Data, Your Control
Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it. We do not have access to your data and cannot modify, view, or delete it. If you wish to delete the data, you can do so by uninstalling the app, which will remove all data from your device (unless backed up).

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app, and we encourage you to review the policy periodically for updates.
